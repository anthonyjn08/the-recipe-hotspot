# **The Recipe Hotspot**

## **Aim of the Site**

The aim of the site is to allow users to find and post their favourite recipes. Users will be able to like their favourite recipes and be involved in the conversation as well by commenting on recipes. Site users can also upload their own recipes to share with the sites user community.

## **Planning stage**

I want the site to almost have a blog like feel with the UI displaying 2 rows of 3 recipes previews, which users are then able to click on to be taken to the full recipe detail view. I have also included meal type and meal tags in the recipe model to allow users to be able to search for these from a sidebar on the main page. The meal types will be starter, main etc and the meal tags will include things such as what meat/fruits are in the meal, or even if the meal is gluten free.

## **Website Design**

### **The Recipe Hotspot Logo**

The sites log was designed by a childhood friend who I've know for about 30 years. He studied graphic design at college and although he doesn't work as a designer he has kept up his love for it as a hobby. I asked him to provide a log for a recipe website with no specific colour palette in mind. As he knows me so well he designed the logo with my favourite colour combinations in mind.
