# **The Recipe Hotspot**

## **Aim of the Site**

The aim of the site is to allow users to find and post their favourite recipes. Users will be able to like their favourite recipes and be involved in the conversation as well by commenting on recipes. Site users can also upload their own recipes to share with the sites user community.

## **Planning stage**

I want the site to almost have a blog like feel with the UI displaying 2 rows of 3 recipes previews, which users are then able to click on to be taken to the full recipe detail view. I have also included meal type and meal tags in the recipe model to allow users to be able to search for these from a sidebar on the main page. The meal types will be starter, main etc and the meal tags will include things such as what meat/fruits are in the meal, or even if the meal is gluten free.
